<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Convert the Mashov timetable into an iCalendar file and make life much easier. This project arose from a major problem: opening Mashov just to access my timetable. I contacted the Mashov contact center and requested this feature, but they refused to implement it. Therefore, I took it upon myself to create it.
