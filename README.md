<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Convert the Mashov time-table into an iCalendar file and make life much easier.
This project came from a major problem, opening Mashov just to get my time-table, I reached the Mashov contact center and asked them to make this feature, they refused to do that so I did it myself.
